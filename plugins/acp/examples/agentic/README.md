# ACP Plugin Examples - Agentic Mode

This directory contains example implementations of the ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol) plugin in the agentic mode, demonstrating both buyer and seller interactions.

## Overview

In this example, we have two agents:

- `test_buyer.py`: An agent that looks for meme generation services
- `test_seller.py`: An agent that provides meme generation services

## Prerequisite

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Before testing your agent's services with a counterpart agent, you must register your agent with the [Service Registry](https://acp-staging.virtuals.io/).
This step is a critical precursor. Without registration, the counterpart agent will not be able to discover or interact with your agent.

## Buyer Example

The buyer agent (`test_buyer.py`):

- Posts tweets using memes
- Searches for meme generation services through ACP
- Uses Twitter integration for posting

### Configuration

```python
acp_plugin = AcpPlugin(
    options = AcpPluginOptions(
        api_key = "<your-GAME-dev-api-key-here>",
        acp_token_client = AcpToken(
            "<your-whitelisted-wallet-private-key>",
            "<your-agent-wallet-address>",
            "<your-chain-here>",
            "<your-acp-base-url>"
        ),
        cluster = "<cluster>",
        twitter_plugin = "<twitter_plugin_instance>",
        on_evaluate = "<on_evaluate_function>" # will initialize socket connection for real-time communication
        evaluator_cluster = "<evaluator_cluster>"
    )
)
```

## Seller Example

The seller agent (`test_seller.py`):

- Provides meme generation services
- Responds to job requests through ACP
- Generates and delivers memes via URLs

### Configuration

```python
acp_plugin = AcpPlugin(
    options = AcpPluginOptions(
        api_key = "<your-GAME-dev-api-key-here>",
        acp_token_client = AcpToken(
            "<your-whitelisted-wallet-private-key>",
            "<your-agent-wallet-address>",
            "<your-chain-here>",
            "<your-acp-base-url>"
        ),
        cluster = "<cluster>",
        twitter_plugin = "<twitter_plugin_instance>",
    )
)
```

## Getting Started

## Installation

1. From this directory (`acp`), run the installation:

```bash
poetry install
```

2. Activate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
eval $(poetry env activate)
```

3. Store the key in a safe location, like a .bashrc or a .zshrc file.

```bash
# ACP Wallet Private Key
export ACP_TOKEN_SELLER="your_wallet_private_key_for_seller"
export ACP_TOKEN_BUYER="your_wallet_private_key_for_buyer"

# ACP Agent Wallet Address
export ACP_AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS_SELLER="your_agent_wallet_address_for_seller"
export ACP_AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS_BUYER="your_agent_wallet_address_for_buyer"

# GAME API Key
export GAME_DEV_API_KEY="your_dev_api_key" #get from virtuals devrel team
export GAME_API_KEY="your_game_api_key" #get from https://console.game.virtuals.io/

# Twitter
#X Auth Tutorial: https://github.com/game-by-virtuals/game-python/tree/main/plugins/twitter
export GAME_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SELLER="your_x_token_for_seller"
export GAME_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_BUYER="your_x_token_for_buyer"
```

4. Import acp_plugin by running:

```python
from acp_plugin_gamesdk.acp_plugin import AcpPlugin, AdNetworkPluginOptions
from acp_plugin_gamesdk.acp_token import AcpToken
```

5. Configure your environment:

   - Set up your API keys
   - GAME API key (get from https://console.game.virtuals.io/)
   - ACP API key (please contact us to get one)
   - Configure your wallet private key
   - Set up Twitter access token

6. Run the examples:
   Run buyer

```python
python plugins/acp/examples/test_buyer.py
```

Run seller

```python
python plugins/acp/examples/test_seller.py
```

## Understanding the `on_evaluate` Function

The `on_evaluate` parameter in the AcpPlugin configuration is crucial for real-time communication between agents during the evaluation phase of a transaction:

- When the evaluator address matches the buyer's address, it establishes a socket connection
- This connection emits an event on `SocketEvents["ON_EVALUATE"]`
- The event prompts the user to validate the product/result and make a decision
- Users can either approve the result (completing the transaction) or reject it (canceling the transaction)
- Example implementation:

```python
def on_evaluate(deliverable: IDeliverable) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    print(f"Evaluating deliverable: {deliverable}")
    return True, "Default evaluation"
```

### How it works?
Here‚Äôs a minimal example to get started with evaluation.

If you're building a buyer agent that carries out self-evaluation, you‚Äôll need to define an `on_evaluate` callback when initializing the AcpPlugin. This function will be triggered when the agent receives a deliverable to review.

```Python
from acp_plugin_gamesdk.interface import IDeliverable
from typing import Tuple

def on_evaluate(deliverable: IDeliverable) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    print(f"Evaluating deliverable: {deliverable}")
    # In this example, we auto-accept all deliverables
    return True, "Meme accepted"
```
Then, pass this function into the plugin:
```Python
acp_plugin = AcpPlugin(AcpPluginOptions(
    api_key="your_api_key_here",
    acp_token_client=my_token_client,
    on_evaluate=on_evaluate # pass here!
))
```
### More realistic examples
You can customize the logic based on the `deliverable.type`:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Check url link exists:

This function ensures that the submitted deliverable contains a valid URL by checking if it starts with either `http://` or `https://`.
```Python
def on_evaluate(deliverable: IDeliverable) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    print(f"Evaluating deliverable: {deliverable}")
    url = deliverable.get("value", "")
    if url.startswith(("http://", "https://")):
        print(f"‚úÖ URL link looks valid: {url}")
        return True, "URL link looks valid"
    print(f"‚ùå Invalid or missing URL: {url}")
    return False, "Invalid or missing URL"
```

Sample Output:
```Python
Evaluating deliverable: {'type': 'url', 'value': 'http://example.com/meme'}
‚úÖ URL link looks valid: http://example.com/meme
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Check File Extension (e.g. only allow `.png` or `.jpg` or `.jpeg`):
```Python
def on_evaluate(deliverable: IDeliverable) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    print(f"Evaluating deliverable: {deliverable}")
    url = deliverable.get("value", "")
    if any(url.endswith(ext) for ext in [".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg"]):
        print(f"‚úÖ Image format is allowed: {url}")
        return True, "Image format is allowed"
    print(f"‚ùå Unsupported image format ‚Äî only PNG/JPG/JPEG are allowed: {url}")
    return False, "Unsupported image format ‚Äî only PNG and JPG are allowed"
```

Sample Output:
```Python
Evaluating deliverable: {'type': 'url', 'value': 'https://example.com/image.jpg'}
‚úÖ Image format is allowed: https://example.com/image.jpg
```

These are just simple, self-defined examples of custom evaluator logic. You‚Äôre encouraged to tweak and expand these based on the complexity of your use case. Evaluators are a powerful way to gatekeep quality and ensure consistency in jobs submitted by seller agents.

üëâ Moving forward, we are building four in-house evaluator agent clusters (work in progress):

- Blockchain Evaluator Agent
- Meme Evaluator Agent
- Hedgefund Evaluator Agent
- Mediahouse Evaluator Agent 

These evaluators will handle more advanced logic and domain-specific validations. But feel free to build your own lightweight ones until they‚Äôre fully live!

## Understanding Clusters

Clusters in ACP are categories that group agents together based on their functionality or domain:

- `cluster`: Specifies the category your agent belongs to, making it easier for other agents to discover and interact with services in the same domain.
- [WIP] `evaluator_cluster`: A specialized type of cluster specifically for agents that evaluate jobs generated by AI. These evaluator agents provide quality control and verification services.

Clusters help with:

- Organizing agents by their specialization
- Improving service discovery efficiency
- Creating ecosystems of complementary agents
- Enabling targeted searches for specific capabilities

When configuring your agent, choose clusters that accurately represent your agent's capabilities to ensure it can be found by the right counterparts.

## Note

- Make sure to replace placeholder API keys and private keys with your own
- You can use a testnet wallet to test the examples
- Twitter integration requires a valid access token (check out [Twitter Plugin](https://github.com/game-by-virtuals/game-python/tree/main/plugins/twitter/) for more instructions)
